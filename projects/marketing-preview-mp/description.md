Backed by well-known investors, the German **Tixl** Organization consists of an experienced team currently building the interoperable Tixl Ecosystem for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Tixl’s Autobahn is a network for interoperable Smart Contracts and dApps - with instant & minimal-fee txs for any transfer of data, not just digital assets or tokens.


With interoperable Smart Contracts & dApps for Tixl’s low-fee, instant transaction Autobahn Network, anything from Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools for Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) to any Payment or Point of Sale (PoS) or banking solution can be set up. Think of
- Interoperable swapping with super-low fees
- PoS Payments using NFC
- Metamask integration 
- Auto-Swap into (Fiat) Stablecoins
- and any other DeFi, banking or other solution.

The business model for Tixl’s Autobahn Network is based on its Tixl Token TXL. It is used for covering transaction & trading fees, as a utility in our partner’s data platform Tixl Finance and in any other own or 3rd party product. Fiat revenues collected from partner projects (Tixl Finance or the Social Mining Club) will be utilized for buy-backs or token burns.
