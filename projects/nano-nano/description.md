Nano provides an intuitive experience that feels like digital currency should - no fuss, no fees, no waiting. This is what an accessible and easy-to-use digital money experience should feel like.

### Easy-to-use and Feeless
Nano is simple and easy-to-use by design. By focusing on transferring value as efficiently as possible, the Nano network is able to offer feeless transactions and provides options for users and services to easily access the empowering and cost-saving qualities of digital money.

### Eco-friendly
As the world continues efforts to reduce pollution and energy consumption, many digital money networks have resorted to wasteful designs to secure their networks. Nano is smartly designed to address this issue by not relying on power-hungry mining for security, but instead uses a lightweight and efficient consensus protocol called Open Representative Voting (ORV) for minimal energy usage.

### Instant
Digital money should be quick and easy-to-use. Whether buying goods at a store, transferring money across borders or making payments online, Nano transactions are completed in under a second so you no longer have to wait. And these are fully settled payments on the network, businesses no longer have to wait for credit card or banking network approval.
